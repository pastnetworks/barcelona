The 4-day programme will consist of lectures and discussions, hands-on practicals, and socials.

##  Lectures and discussions

* Introduction to the summer school - what, why, and how of past network research
* Network analysis and methods
* Research design
* Critical perspectives on historical and archaeological data
*	Developing your own future past network research projects. Discussion and evaluation
*	How to take the next steps in the past networks community – conferences, resources and publications
  
##  Practicals

* Computational basics - set up coding workspace, and read network data
* How to obtain, create, and clean network data
* Exploratory network analysis
* Network visualization techniques
* Networks as a model, a tool to gain insight into phenomena and data. Poster creation
* Best practices: data and results deposition and documentation
* Work on projects
* Elective advanced tutorials

## Socials

* Welcome and introductions
* Historical tour of Barcelona
* Joint dinner _included_

<!-- The school is structured around theoretical lectures and computational practicals, alongside many socials.
