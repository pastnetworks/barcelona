SUBSTITUE THIS WITH TOM's BLURB
The Barcelona Past Networks Summer School is an annual 5-day summer school in Barcelona teaching the theory and practice of past network research. 
It is aimed at those studying the human past (historians, archaeologists, classicists, â€¦). No prior computational skills are required, but willingness to learn is essential.
