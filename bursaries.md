The summer school is able to offer a small number of bursaries between 75 EUR and 300 EUR that can only be used to support expenses directly related to attending the Barcelona Past Networks Summer School. Eligible expenses include:
* BPNSS registration fee
* Accommodation during the summer school
* Travel to and from the summer school

## Bursary application procedure
There is no separate bursary application procedure. You have to apply for a bursary alongside your application for the summer school, before the 21 January 2023 deadline.

In the registration form, answer “Yes” to the question “Do you want to be considered for a bursary?”.

Please describe in no more than 200 words your motivation for applying for a bursary.
